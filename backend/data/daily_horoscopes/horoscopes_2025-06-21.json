      "daily": "There may be a great deal of opposition in your way today, Aries, but try not to dwell on it. The key is to stay levelheaded and maintain a positive outlook. This is a day in which you can bring a great deal of balance to issues by understanding and respecting the other side. Have charity for those who are making sacrifices so that you may have a more comfortable ride.",
      "yesterday": "Today you may have difficulty connecting with others, Aries. People may be unnecessarily harsh for no reason. Try not to get too emotionally worked up over any slights. Keep a safe distance between you and the drama around you. The next step you take might send you into quicksand, so make sure there's a good friend nearby to pull you out.",
      "tomorrow": "If you meet someone new today, Aries, break him or her in gradually. Don't spill all the beans at once. Let the person warm up to your intense emotional nature before you unleash it full force. People are going to need their space, so make sure you allow enough room for emotional and physical freedom. Think about taking a long trip or short vacation of some sort."
    },
    "taurus": {
      "daily": "The pieces of today's puzzle may not fit into place, Taurus, and it's possible that you have no idea why. Don't stress over something you don't quite understand. The key to making things work out is listening. Adjustments will definitely be needed on both sides, but this can only happen if both parties are willing to open their ears and understand one another's perspective.",
      "yesterday": "You will be the hit of the party today, Taurus. Everyone wants to talk to you. Great transitions are happening in your life right now, and you should look at how you can adopt new principles and attitudes toward them. Your emotions suggest that you take an unconventional approach to the day. The things you learn may be things you want to incorporate into your being on a long-term basis.",
      "tomorrow": "Spare no emotional or monetary expense today, Taurus. Whatever you put into this day will come back to you tenfold. Feel free to indulge and delight in your fun-loving nature. This day speaks of freedom from restraint of all kinds. Break the chains and explore new worlds in your mind and your physical surroundings. Don't say no when the adventure bus comes around to pick you up."
    },
    "gemini": {
      "daily": "Today can be an extremely productive day, Gemini. You're in a good space from which to work and this will aid you in all your endeavors. Today is also excellent for looking at some of the long-term trends moving through your life now. Consider the next five or ten years and think about how your actions will affect your future. Plan ahead to get ahead.",
      "yesterday": "Unless you want to get into an intellectual sparring match today, you might want to stay home, Gemini. But this battle of wits could also take place in your own kitchen, so perhaps you should take a long walk by yourself and avoid others. Or simply prepare for battle. People aren't apt to be very sympathetic to your cause, so wear your armor.",
      "tomorrow": "Today isn't a day to stay inside and sulk, Gemini. Put the past behind you and move on. Grab opportunities with both hands and rev your engine into high gear. Stop looking at what lies behind and focus on the wide-open horizon in front of you. This is an excellent day to turn up the heat and start brewing some new adventures. Transform your life into an action movie with you as the star."
    },
    "cancer": {
      "daily": "There may be a battle between old and new in your world today, Cancer. A reserved and old-fashioned perspective has a strong hold on the prevailing sentiment. This feeling is likely going to hit you square in the face as you lean toward the unconventional and more revolutionary approach to life. See what sort of past lessons you can learn from as you build the future.",
      "yesterday": "Spend time with good friends today, Cancer. Share dinner with people you love and feel free to be generous with the food and drink. You have the ability to control just about every situation. Remind others that they're part of a greater whole and that working together is the key to accomplishing great feats. Inspire others to be the best they can be.",
      "tomorrow": "Get your favorite music out of the closet today, Cancer. Have a dance party in your living room and liven things up with some freshly cut flowers on your table. This is a great day to direct your energies outward into the world. Go on a radical adventure that you didn't think was possible. Plow headfirst into new projects and let your good luck carry you through. Don't worry about the details."
    },
    "leo": {
      "daily": "People may seem a bit stubborn today. Your powers of adaptation may be put to the test, Leo. The people around you are likely to call on your tender, sympathetic nature. Offer a nurturing ear and strong shoulder for others to cry on. Keep things low key and steady. The more grounded you are, the easier it will be to get along with the energy of today.",
      "yesterday": "Unexpected things are on the way and it's best to be emotionally and physically prepared. You may be rather indecisive, but when you do act, your moves manifest in short, powerful bursts. Work to keep your dreams in motion. There are people out there who have the resources you need to be successful. Befriend them and share your goals.",
      "tomorrow": "It may be extremely hard for you to make decisions about anything today, Leo. Don't stress about work or the things you need to get done. With today's aspects, it's a day that shouldn't be filled with sour energy from the past. You experience a rebirth every time you wake up in the morning. Venture forth into new adventures!"

    "virgo": {
      "daily": "When you go up a flight of stairs, take one step at a time today, Virgo. Skipping up the staircase two at a time could result in you falling back to the bottom. Trying to rush things today will leave holes in your projects. Finish jobs completely by making sure that every step is thoroughly taken care of. Don't ignore the details.",
      "yesterday": "Why go through today with doubts or fears, Virgo? You have every reason to be happy. The things you project to the world today will prove extremely favorable. Don't hesitate to enjoy this day to the fullest. People will be eager to participate in whatever you have going on. As long as you remain confident in yourself, everyone else will agree.",
      "tomorrow": "Today should run quite smoothly for you, Virgo. You will find that there's a great deal of power fueling your emotions and that you're able to take that power to the extreme. Use your strong, dynamic nature to win the hearts of others. Lead the charge toward good-natured fun. You will be laid-back, easygoing, and adventurous. Take a long-distance trip in your mind."

    "libra": {
      "daily": "Today is a terrific day for taking the plunge or making an investment, Libra. Luck and prosperity are in your favor, and you have the opportunity to make some very profitable financial decisions. Your intuition is right in line with what you need to do. Make the best deal possible and provide a fair and secure future for you and your investment.",
      "yesterday": "Be aggressive with your thoughts today, Libra. You might feel a bit emotionally detached. You will most certainly want your freedom. Spend some time alone to sort things out. An ex from years ago might appear on your doorstep, so don't be too surprised when he or she shows up. Take a nonjudgmental attitude toward everything you encounter.",
      "tomorrow": "Don't get upset if people don't take you quite as seriously as you'd like today, Libra. It's in the nature of the day to keep things light and uplifting. Come out of the intensity of the last couple days and laugh out loud. Don't stress over things you don't understand. Go with the flow and keep smiling. You can't go wrong as long as you join in the good cheer and merriment of the day."
    },
    "scorpio": {
      "daily": "The key to being successful today is to maintain an air of stability. If others see you as too flighty and off the wall, they will hesitate about putting their trust in you. Make sure you do those things in your power that will help boost your clout. You will need this support from others later. Make a solid base to build on.",
      "yesterday": "What are you waiting for, Scorpio? Go for the gold. All you need to do is shine. You have the opportunity to merge with powerful groups today, so make sure to keep your eyes open. Do things that will improve your current status in a finance-related situation. Your sharp wit and endless facts and information will come in handy. Have a joke at the ready.",
      "tomorrow": "You might find that something or someone is purposefully trying to make things difficult for you today, Scorpio. It might seem like you're trying to get a handle on the issues, but somehow things are slipping through your fingers. Don't make any major decisions, and certainly don't try to herd people into corners. Let others have their freedom and consider simply riding out the storm."
    },
    "sagittarius": {
      "daily": "Today is a very expansive day for you, Sagittarius. Your emotions can lead you into favorable situations with others. The pace of the day may seem a little slow, but this can be used to your advantage. Examine every detail with care and try not to leave any piece of the equation unaccounted for. You should enjoy a stable, caring mood that radiates out and draws others toward you.",
      "yesterday": "Rid yourself of all regret, Sagittarius. Guilt is useless. It doesn't do anyone any good. Your emotions are volatile and apt to erupt in unexpected bursts. Feel free to let it all out. Today isn't the best day to ask for sympathy, but that shouldn't be your goal anyway. Only you can clean out the negative issues that are floating around in your heart and mind.",
      "tomorrow": "Lay low today, Sagittarius. Don't try to force any answers from people. Eat a healthy breakfast and stay away from caffeine. Relate to people on an intellectual or philosophical level and discuss the meaning of life. If you're looking for sympathy, you may need to wait a couple days. People aren't in the mood. They just want to be left alone."

    "capricorn": {
      "daily": "You may feel like you're coming up against a brick wall, Capricorn. Your emotions are a bit stifled and you may find that you're more stubborn than usual. There is a large and beneficial force that you can tap into today, as long as you keep your intuition open. The less you search for it, the more likely it will come to you. Something may spur you to act.",
      "yesterday": "There's a fire burning in you today, Capricorn. Be careful how you use it. There's a chance you could offend someone if you get too excited and fail to notice how your arrogant attitude affects people around you. Take your joy and spread it to the collective by empowering others. You will feel better about yourself and make more friends in the process.",
      "tomorrow": "Inspire others to come out of their shells today, Capricorn. Have them join you on the sunny side of the street. Share your cheer with other people and lead them into boisterous discussions about the world. You will be on cloud nine, with a great deal of strength behind your happy-go-lucky emotions. Keep things light and don't worry about tomorrow until it comes."
    },
    "aquarius": {
      "daily": "Smile at the world today, Aquarius. Be thankful for the things you have and the people around you. Amplify the cozy, warm feeling inside and spread this love to others. This is a very expansive time for you in which you can get quite a bit accomplished if you set your mind to it. Radiate your true nature through every cell in your body and watch as the opportunities come your way.",
      "yesterday": "You might have to toughen your skin today, Aquarius. Don't automatically write someone off because of an action that you think is offensive. Allow others to have their opinions and respect their right to express them openly. Keep an open mind and don't judge. Maintain a diplomatic attitude and keep your critical thoughts to yourself. Don't think less of others in order to feel better about yourself.",
      "tomorrow": "Keep your cool if something goes wrong today, Aquarius. Don't be so impatient about fixing a problem that you end up doing something rash. You may do more damage than you would if you just let things sit for a couple days. Mull over the situation, talk it out with others, and approach the issue at another time with a different frame of mind."
    },
    "pisces": {
      "daily": "Today isn't the best day to play practical jokes, Pisces, so put away the disappearing ink. Stick close to home. Find security in doing things you know how to do best. Hang a painting and cook a scrumptious dinner. You can inspire others with your smile, so use it. Don't get down if your thoughts aren't flowing well with the group. This is a sign that you should spend some time alone.",
      "yesterday": "Break away from all mental constraints today, Pisces. The only thing holding you back could be your own mind. Don't fear failure. The cards are in your favor. Move forward with the attitude that you're going to succeed, and you will. Your emotions are strong and active. Things are resonating well for you, so speak your mind openly.",
      "tomorrow": "Play the lottery today, Pisces. The concept for you is profit with no effort. The windfall will come when you least expect it. The less you try to shape things, the more they will generally flow in your favor. Enjoy the day and don't sweat the details. Things will work themselves out. People may be quite emotionally charged, but don't let their behavior throw you off balance."
